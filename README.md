Application Name

DisAlert




Idea/Working
 
The app will have the following features:

1.It will alert users of that specific geographical area in which any disaster is predicted and keep updating them. It will also give them emergency contact details and preventive measures to take at that time for that particular disaster.

2.It will have a button (which will be pressed by the user in an emergency situation) which will send the person's location and keep updating its location until network connection fails (which happens in almost all natural diasaster).
All the data with location will be updated and saved real time to track them if needed while rescue operation. It will help significantly for tracking lost people during rescue operation.

3.It will have a feature which will show past accidents and their summary at the user's current location (it can be changed) so that they can be aware of tackling them if they occur in near future.

3.We will create a service through which anyone around the globe can donate for the ongoing disaster. It will list all ongoing disasters/calamities and various ways to donate (food, clothes, water, etc. can also be donated if they are near to the affected area)

4.We can include a feature which will send user's all contacts an inbuilt message with location if the emergency button is pressed.
